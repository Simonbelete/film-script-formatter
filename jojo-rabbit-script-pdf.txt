                             SMITH'S GROVE, ILLINOIS
                                                   OCTOBER 30
                         
                         
          EXT. SMITH'S GROVE STATE HOSPITAL. DAY                           
                         
          A cold brick building. Isolated. Surrounded on all sides by      
          barbed-wire fencing.                                             
                         
          A RENTAL CAR pulls up to the SECURITY GATE. A SECURITY GUARD     
          checks the credentials of the driver. The Guard nods to the      
          GUARD BOOTH. The GATE OPENS. The rental car drives through.      
                         
                         
          INT. SECURITY STATION. SMITH'S GROVE STATE HOSPITAL. DAY.
                         
          CLOSE ON: A HAND holding a MICROPHONE. The hand cranes the       
          mike around the to pick up sounds of maniacal laughter           
          echoing from the corridor.                                       
                         
          INSERTS of the corresponding inspiration of these sounds.
                         
          REVEAL: DANA HAINES (30's), activating a TAPE RECORDER. She's
          with AARON JOSEPH-KOREY (40); both scholarly, British. Aaron
          signs some documents at a CHECK-IN DESK. They look to each
          other. Aaron speaks into her microphone.
                         
                                             DANA
                    Check, check.
                         
                                             AARON
                    Testing, testing. One, two, three.
                         
          Among the SECURITY GUARDS, a NURSE works behind the security
          desk of what looks to be a minimum security institution. The
          nurse places a needle on a record player. A joyous song from
          a 1930's musical plays.
                         
          Aaron looks through the security window and sees a DOCTOR
          writing something down and speaking to a PATIENT and a guard,
          KUNEMAN. His ballpoint pen runs out of ink. He shakes it,
          discards it and then reaches into his lab coat pocket for a
          more elegant pen to complete his prescription and signature.
          He glances through the glass at his visitors.
                         
          Dana raises her mic to the door. WE HEAR SOUNDS through
          warped distortion. THEN: A loud BUZZER snaps us back to          
          reality as a ward activates the door lock.
                         
          CLOSE ON: The mechanics of the security locks, bars, etc.
                                                                   2.
                         
                         
          A GREEN LIGHT FLASHES as the door opens and DR. RANBIR         
          SARTAIN appears. A psychiatrist with a thick accent.           
                         
                              DR. SARTAIN
                    Good afternoon. I'm Dr. Ranbir
                    Sartain.
                         
                                             DANA
                    Thank you for taking the time to
                    meet with us. We were hoping to
                    have this chance before he is
                    transferred to the new facility.
                    Glass Hill is far less                               
                    accommodating.
                         
                              DR. SARTAIN
                    Glass Hill is the pit of hell.                       
                    Underfunded and short staffed. For
                    years he has been kept here to be
                    studied. I suppose the state has
                    lost interest in discovering
                    anything further.
                         
                                             AARON
                    Well... That's why we're here.
                         
                                             DANA
                    Do you mind if I record this?
                         
                              DR. SARTAIN
                                       (A SMILE)
                    Why not?
                         
                         
          INT. HALLWAY. SMITH'S GROVE STATE HOSPITAL. DAY.
                         
          A loud BUZZER as the door shuts. Sartain escorts Aaron and
          Dana down a hall. Disturbed faces of PATIENTS pass. Many
          behind bars, others with CLINICAL ESCORTS. Dana records
          Sartain as they walk.
                         
                                             DANA
                    How long have you been working with
                    him?
                         
                              DR. SARTAIN
                    I've examined every case file
                    written on him. I was a scholar of
                    Dr. Loomis before he passed away.
                    Then I lobbied the University of
                    Illinois to be assign to Michael                     
                    myself.
                                                          3.
                         
                         
                                             DANA
                    Any progress?
                         
                              DR. SARTAIN
                    He has been seen by over 50
                    clinical psychiatrists. And with
                    each, many different opinions.
                    Loomis reasoned that he was nothing
                    more than pure evil.
                         
                                             DANA
                    Any you agree with this diagnosis?
                         
                              DR. SARTAIN
                    Evil is not a diagnosis. Under my
                    care, we implemented a holistic
                    form of therapy. Since that time,
                    his tendency for violence has
                    essentially been erased.
                         
                                             AARON
                    His response to your specific
                    treatment has been effective?
                         
                              DR. SARTAIN
                    We left two kitty cats in his cell
                    overnight and both remained
                    unharmed.
                                       (A SMILE)
                    I hate to disappoint you.
                         
          Aaron stop walking.
                         
                                             AARON
                    So you're telling us that there is
                    no similarity between the murderous
                    maniac that made newspaper
                    headlines in 1978 and the amenable
                    patient of this institution?                
                         
          Sartain laughs.
                         
                               DR. SARTAIN
                    Michael Myers is an evolving, aging
                    creature like we all are. And
                    although we have worked very
                    closely with him, these halls
                    display the limitations of my
                    analysis. Loomis saw Michael as a           
                    beast in the wild. He witnessed
                    human behavior at its most primal,
                    while the rest of us only have the
                    opportunity of observation in
                    captivity.
                                                                   4.
                         
                         
          Sartain uses a key to open a heavy door that leads into...
                         
                         
          EXT. COURTYARD. SMITH'S GROVE STATE HOSPITAL. DAY.
                         
          Sartain walks them into an outside courtyard. A few
          DISFIGURED or DISABLED RESIDENTS roam about.                    
                         
                              DR. SARTAIN
                    Our patients get fresh air and
                    sunshine, a view, proper exercise,
                    a healthy diet. It pains me to see                    
                    him transferred to a less than                        
                    desirable' facility.
                                       (POINTING)
                    There he is. He can speak. He
                    just chooses not to.
                         
          Aaron and Dana look. WE FIND THE SHAPE OF A MAN sixty feet
          away standing shackled to the ground in the middle of the
          concrete yard. A YELLOW PAINTED SQUARE creates a twenty foot
          frame around him. Tall, strong, aged, dressed in white.
                         
          TWO SECURITY OFFICERS stand watch. SIX OTHER PATIENTS stand
          scattered through the yard.
                         
                                             AARON
                    I'd love to stand near him and get
                    a sense of his awareness... Or lack
                    of awareness.
                         
                              DR. SARTAIN
                    Make no mistake. He is aware. He
                    was watching you as you arrived.
                    When he's not out here in the
                    courtyard, he walks from this
                    window to that window, to the
                    other. Observing things.
                         
          Aaron and Dana look curiously to each other.
